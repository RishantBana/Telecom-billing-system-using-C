## 🛠️ How It Works

Each customer's bill is calculated based on a usage rate of `$0.10` per minute. The program uses a `Customer` structure to store each customer's information, with a menu-driven interface allowing users to perform actions on these records.

### 📂 Data Structure

The `Customer` structure stores customer data in an array:

```c
typedef struct {
    char name[50];
    char phone[15];
    float usage;
    float totalBill;
} Customer;
```
